# Data Examples

A collection of simple notebooks to help me remember how to access ocean data sets and make simple plots.

Almost all the examples are things I'm learning from others expertise on the web, and *for sure* all the tools are due to the expertise and effort of others! So thanks!!

Some are just scratch paper and not fleshed out at all. 

Many of these are examples I use(d) in my integrated ocean observing class. Hopefully contributions from students to follow!


Hopefully by clicking the link below you can run these notebooks without installing anything!
